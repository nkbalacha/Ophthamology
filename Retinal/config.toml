# FIXME: CAUTION: watch peak memory usage in a trial run and set accordingly. # processes = number of physical cores may crash due to insufficient memory. Risky to utilize more than 70% system memory. Each process will use memory proportional to the size of the raw/preprocessed recording.
# CAUTION: threading + multiprocessing is not a good idea! Keep _N_THREADS=1 if _N_PROCESSES is high
